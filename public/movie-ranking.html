<h1>The three best movies according to Yash</h1>
<hr />

<h2>Pushpa</h2>
<p>This is most favourite as this is one man show of Arjun</p>
<h2>12thFail</h2>
<p>This is my second most favourite as this show the determination of a person</p>
<h2>The Gazi Attack</h2>
<p>This shows that we dont need to have everything to win, we just need us with whole determination</p>
